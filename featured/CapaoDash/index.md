Example of an application created using Python. It is possible to carry out quick and intuitive analyzes of the real estate market, checking which regions are in greatest demand and where we could have good opportunities to buy and sell a property. All this through a Dashboard with an elegant and highly professional aesthetic.

I used a database from the city of Cap√£o da Canoa/RS - Brazil.
